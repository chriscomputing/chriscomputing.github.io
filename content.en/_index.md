I'm Chris, a German Computer Science student finishing his bachelors. Additionally, I work at as a student assistant for a larger company.  
In my studies, I work with many different topics. They include theoretical Computer Science, algorithms, cyber security, data science and artificial intelligence.  
I used to do a lot of web development in Python at work, but my focus recently shifted to scientific computing, which is also the topic of the bachelor thesis I'm currently writing.  
In my leisure time, I like doing small programming projects of my own, some of them get featured on this blog. Additionally, I run a small homelab for my family and me.  
Another interest of mine is Linux itself. I've been using Linux exclusively for the past 3 years, mostly [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), a distribution based on Arch Linux. My servers, and recently my main desktop too, run Ubuntu. I even managed to convince my family to switch to Linux, although I had to promise that I'd service their laptops.
